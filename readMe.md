The final exercise involves using HTML and CSS to create this Postcard and we are gonna save it using version control:

1.  Create a Github account and install git in your system.
2.  Create a new repository and connect it to your local project using:

        a. git remote add origin <repo-url>
        b. git remote -v
        c. git add .
        d. git commit -m "some explanation of the commit"
        e. git push -u origin main

3.  Now look at the image to learn what you need to create.
